For this activity we were required to build a portfolio web page with a navigation bar directing the user to three different pages - one for about me, one for projects, and one for a contact form.  We used Bootstrap code and adapted where necessary, and had to make our pages responsive to mobile devices, tablets, and laptops or desktops as well.

The most challenging part of this assignment was figuring out how to make the pages responsive.  Once that was accomplished I felt as if I had a major key unlocked in my understanding, which would take me light years ahead of where I was!

I altered my cards on the portfolio page so that instead of clicking a link at the bottom of each card (i.e., "click here for link") the user can click anywhere on the card to proceed to the target site.  I used an href tag with a class of "card" for each card to accomplish this.
Please forgive my simple projects, as those were pretty much from the pre-work.  

I added the sticky footer at the bottom of each page so that I could get the bonus.

Just as an aside, the form on the last page was not required to actually work to save anything, as that is part of JavaScript.  

I am looking forward to your review and feedback.  Thanks for your time and attention to my project.
